every philo need to have last time to eat;

one thread just to check if the philo died;




even number of philos:	time_to_die = time_to_eat + time_to_sleep + 10;
odd number of philos: time_to_die = time_to_eat * 2 + time_to_sleep + 10;


odd sleep = time_to_eat / 2

odd takes fork from the right;
even takes fork from the left;


number of philos = id;
